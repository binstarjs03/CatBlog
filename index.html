        <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species
            in
            the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the
            wild
            members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the
            feral
            cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
            ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
        <p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
            sharp
            teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its night vision and sense of
            smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
            growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a
            solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too
            faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It also
            secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>
